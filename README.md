# Simon-Game
I’ve developed the classic Simon Game.
The object of this game is to repeat a series of random tile clicks created by the game. After each round, the sequence becomes progressively longer and more complex which makes it harder to remember.
Typically,we’ll have four different tiles, each with a unique colour and sound which is activated when pressed. The sound aids the player in remembering the sequence and the game ends if the player misses a step in the sequence.
